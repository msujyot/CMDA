Hey guys,

I mentioned this briefly last week, but I'd like to get a data set for our project as soon as possible. I'm going to be out of town this weekend, so I can't meet up, but I'll have internet and if you guys need me, you can text my cell (703.468.4342).

For the project, the data set we need has to have:
	- At least 7 variables
	- Some numeric, some character
	- At least 60 observations

I found a few data sets that were interesting to me. Check them out and share any you've found. :)
 
     - The million song has tons of metadata, and there seem to be a few datasets there. There's the lyrics one (http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/musixmatch#faq) but the site has a couple others I believe.
     
      - http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/category/datasets has a few interesting ones. I like the ones on Aging, Family Bonds, Diet/Gambling/Movies but honestly, there's enough variety on here that it might be fun to play with any of them.
      
 See you guys in class tomorrow!
